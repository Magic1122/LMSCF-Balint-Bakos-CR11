# LMSCF-Balint-Bakos-CR11


Hello, this is The Pet Adoption Project, written in MVC design pattern.

Please run the files from your root of the htdocs, if you are using XAMPP it should be C:/xampp/htdocs
So the full path should be C:/xampp/htdocs/cr11_bakos_petadoption
Naming is really important for the setup, unless it won't work, if you need to use different setup there is a 
config.php file in the app/config folder and furthermore because of the urls you need to the RewriteBase in the /public/.htaccess file
But u don't need to change anything if u are using the same naming and path like I said before.
If u need help with running the APP please contact me!
